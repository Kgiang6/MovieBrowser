Bugs:
No known bugs with the application.

How it works:
Search for a movie by entering the movie name. If the movie does not exist, the results page will be empty.
If movies with the user input exists, it will populate the results page with all movies that contains the
user input. On the bottom will be "Back", "Home", and "Next". "Back" will return you to the previous page.
"Home" will return you to the search screen. "Next" will bring up the next page of results. If you are at the 
last page, the "Next" button will be unclickable. To look for additional info on a specific movie, click on the movie
title to be brought to the Additional Info screen.
